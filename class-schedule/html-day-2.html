				<h2 class="header">Day 2 Part 1: Introducing the Box Model</h2>

				<p class="box-explanation">In a document, each element is represented as a rectangular box. Determining the size, properties — like its color, background, borders aspect — and the position of these boxes is the goal of the rendering engine.

				In CSS, each of these rectangular boxes is described using the standard box model. This model describes the content of the space taken by an element. Each box has four edges: the margin edge, border edge, padding edge, and content edge.

				<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US">The Mozilla Developer Network</a>, or MDN for short, is a tremendous resource not only for all things CSS, but front-end web development in general.  Below are links that explain the three main components of the box model in more depth:</p>

					<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border">Border</a></p>

				<p class="box-explanation">Here is the good part, each major web browser makes it easy for you to figure out how to reference the Box Model of any website on the internet.  Google Chrome, in particular, in its developer tools has the box model of the selected element rendered automatically.  An example of such is shown below:</p>

				<h2 class="header">Day 2 Part 2: Seperate CSS file and how to link to HTML file</h2>

				<p class="css-explanation">Linking your file is the most common method of attaching CSS rules to an HTML document. With this method all of your style rules are contained in a single text file that is saved with the .CSS extension. This file is saved on your server and you link to it directly from each HTML file. The link is just a simple line of HTML that you put in the <code> "< head>" </code> section of your HTML document, it looks like this:</p>

				<pre>
						"< link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mystyles.css" media="screen"/>"
				</pre>

				<p>Make sure you include the correct path to your CSS file in the href. If the CSS file is in the same folder as your HTML file then no path is required (like the example above) but if it's saved in a folder, then specify it like this href="foldername/mystyles.css". </p>

				<h2 class="header">Day 2 Part 3: CSS Classes and ID's</h2>

				<p class="classes"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Class_selectors">CSS Classes:</a> In an HTML document, CSS class selectors match an element based on the contents of the element's class attribute. The class attribute is defined as a space-separated list of items, and one of those items must match exactly the class name given in the selector.</p>

				<p class="IDs"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/ID_selectors">CSS Id's:</a> In an HTML document, CSS ID selectors match an element based on the contents of that element's ID attribute, which must match exactly the value given in the selector.</p>

				<h2 class="header">Day 2 Part 4: Pseudo Selectors</h2>

				<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes">A CSS pseudo-class</a> is a keyword added to selectors that specifies a special state of the element to be selected. For example :hover will apply a style when the user hovers over the element specified by the selector.

				Pseudo-classes, together with pseudo-elements, let you apply a style to an element not only in relation to the content of the document tree, but also in relation to external factors like the history of the navigator (:visited, for example), the status of its content (like :checked on some form elements), or the position of the mouse (like :hover which lets you know if the mouse is over an element or not).  Below is a full list of pseudo-selects that you can choose to incorporate in your webpage:</p>

				<h2 class="header">Problems: Problem 2</h2>

				<p>Try to replicate the below mockup for a fashion blog webpage.  The Box Model, CSS Classes and ID's, and pseudo selectors can all be used to create the optimal user experience for a vistor checking out the blog!</p>
