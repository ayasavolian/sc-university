            <div class = "topic-description">
              HTML (Hyper-text markup language) is the way that you can display web pages. All websites you HTML to show their website. CSS (cascade style sheet) 
              provides the styling to the HTML in order to make the page look a certain way. For example, that top bar ^^ uses styling to make it purple so we can give the website
              a certain look and feel. Both HTML & CSS exist on the client-side but we'll get into that later.

              This class will teach you the fundamentals in order to create websites. In terms of being an SC at Marketo, you'll be able to contribute to projects, create
              emails, & create landing pages within Marketo. Just a heads up, this is the way I've learned how to code. Everyone will have opinions on 'best practice' when
              it comes to developing client-side. This is what I think is best practice and in terms of consistency it has never failed me. So ready to get started?

              Part 1: Getting Started
            </div>
            <div class = "topic-description">
              Alright first thing youre going to do is go to google and search for sublime text. Download <a href = "http://www.sublimetext.com/"> sublime text </a> 2 or 3, 
              doesn't really matter. Once you do, we can get started. Go ahead and open it up and you'll see a blank black page.... Perfect. Now what you should do is create
              a folder on your desktop for this course. Once you do that, go ahead and save this new sublime text file into that folder <b> save it as a .html file, and name it 
              whateveryourfilenameis.html when you save it </b>. Great lets get started now.

              Part 2: Starting Your First .HTML Page
            </div>
            <div class = "topic-description">
              The first thing you want to do is make your file look like this...
              <img class = "inserted-image" src = "../class-schedule/images/day1image1.png">
              The DOCTYPE html is required for all html pages. The head is where we'll be inserting any references to other files. For example, we want to make it so that this
              webpage uses javascript, or css pages we'll be inserting our references there. The body is where we'll be placing all of our actual HTML. And of course, this is all
              wrapped in an html tag meaning that this is where the html page should start and end.
              Before we start defining a bunch of HTML elements, let's test to see if this works. Go ahead and type "Hello World!" into the body like this...
              <img class = "inserted-image" src = "../class-schedule/images/day1image2.png">
              Now go to the folder your HTML file is in and double click on it. It should open up in the browser and you should see a white page with just "Hello World!" written like this...
              <img class = "inserted-image" src = "../class-schedule/images/day1image3.png">     
              Great! now our HTML page definitely works and we've properly set it up. 
            </div>
            <div class = "topic-header">
              Part 3: Creating HTML Elements
            </div>
            <div class = "topic-description">        
              Let's go ahead and start outlining our actual HTML now. Now again, I'll preface this by saying I'm going to teach you the way I write HTML. If you look at most modern
              websites, they'll use these things called 'divs' in order to define different areas of the HTML and that's what I use. I don't really bother with other HTML elements because
              the div is the most versatile HTML element and we'll be using it for everything. Let's go ahead and start defining an area of the page now.
              <img class = "inserted-image" src = "../class-schedule/images/day1image4.png">
              A div is a block section of the page. Similar to how we write in the body tag to associate it with the HTML itself, we write inside the div element to associate it with the div
              element. The "Hello World!" is now placed within the div. Similarly we use a /div tag to end the element. This structure is the way we'll place all our divs going forward. The
              next thing we're going to do is associate some styling with the div. This type of styling we're about to do is considered 'inline-styling' which is fine for now. What we're going to
              do is change the text for Hello World to be green. 
              <img class = "inserted-image" src = "../class-schedule/images/day1image5.png">    
              If you go look at the file (again double click on it on your desktop or folder you placed it in) you'll notice that the text is now green. There are <b> a lot </b> of different
              stylings that can be used for an HTML element. Today we'll cover the basics. Notice the format for styling is 'attribute : attribute-value;'... this will be consistent throughout.
              Well, some good news. You just created your first HTML element and used CSS! I'd give you +5 points but I'm too lazy to make this gamified... anyway lets keep moving. <br><br>
              The next thing we'll do is create more divs and we'll see how these little sections interact with each other. Let's go ahead and create a new div right under this one.
              <img class = "inserted-image" src = "../class-schedule/images/day1image6.png">
              Now if we preview this... we should get something that looks like this...
              <img class = "inserted-image" src = "../class-schedule/images/day1image7.png">
              Now youre probably wondering... why the hell aren't those side by side?? Well the way that divs work is that they take up entire blocks on the page that build from the top down. 
              So the next thing we'll do is learn to assess how our HTML looks in the browser using Inspect Element. Right click on the HTML page you have previewed in the browser -> Inspect Element ->
              Click on Inspect Element. You should see this...                                   
              <img class = "inserted-image" src = "../class-schedule/images/day1image8.png">
              The thing you'll notice now is that an entire HTML page is structured in 'branches', meaning that they are sections within sections. 
              <img class = "inserted-image" src = "../class-schedule/images/day1image9.png">        
              First thing you'll notice is that when you highlight over the divs they represent sections on the page that will be highlighted in blue. This is the section of the page that the div
              is taking up. Next thing you should notice is that the div's are tabbed in from the body element. That's because they are within the body element and the same with our text within the divs. 
              As we are about to see, you can place divs within divs to extend this branching even further. 
            </div>
            <div class = "topic-header">
              Part 4: Adding More Styling - Float
            </div>
            <div class = "topic-description">        
              <b> Well, how do we get these two divs to align next to each other? </b> Styling of course. There is a CSS attribute called 'display' with the value of 'inline-block' that can place two divs that
              are siblings in a tree structure next to each other (and by sibling I mean they sit at the same level in the tree structure). Let's try it out.
              <img class = "inserted-image" src = "../class-schedule/images/day1image10.png">
              If you preview, they should be sitting side by side. If they aren't makes ure to double check your syntax on the styling... remember its 'attribute : attribute-value;'. Great, now let's learn about
              some of the attributes of styling with inline-block. Let's change the size of the font of the first div to 36px. Going to give you a little test.. go ahead do that without me. The attribute is 'font-size'
              and the attribute-value will be '36px'... you get it? If not check <a href = "http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_font_font-size.asp">this out</a>, (when in doubt google it, and ignore the tags around the
              styling for now just concentrate on the attribute and attribute value). Now when you preview the page you'll notice that both "Hello World!" and "Hello World Two!" are on the same line, meaning they are 
              both aligned to the bottom of their respective divs so that they still vertically align to the bottom. This is a property of inline-block. What if we wanted the text to be aligned to the top-left of the respective
              divs? display: inline-block is great for aligning text of the same size or divs of the same size, but is not optimal for aligning divs/text of different sizes. <br><br>
              Before we get started on that issue, let's first place both divs in another 'container' div or 'parent' div and extend out our branch structure. It should look like this...
              <img class = "inserted-image" src = "../class-schedule/images/day1image11.png">
              Next, let's get rid of 'display: inline-block;' in both divs. Instead what we can do to vertically and horizontally align these two sentences to the top-left of their respective 
              divs is use something called 'float'. Let's go ahead and place 'float: left;' as an attribute in the styling of both divs.  
              <img class = "inserted-image" src = "../class-schedule/images/day1image12.png">
              If you preview the html page now you'll notice that both of the divs align to the top-left and now are flexible which we'll see in a second. What we'll want to also do, <b> which should be done for
              most parent divs when using float </b> is add 'display: inline-block;' to it.
              <img class = "inserted-image" src = "../class-schedule/images/day1image13.png">
              The reason for this is to make sure that the parent encapsulates the divs that are floating within it. If 'display:inline-block' is not added then the height of the parent div will be 0px... which is bad.
              Point is, make sure to add display: inline-block. <br><br> Now, I'm going to preface continuing again by saying what I just did can be accomplished using something called 'span'. If interested, google span
              and you can read more about it. Again, I use only divs because of consistency and ease-of-use now that I'm used to it. Theres more than one way to accomplish the same thing in HTML.

              Part 5: Adding Even More Styling - Sizing
            </div>
            <div class = "topic-description">        
              The last thing we're going to go over today is how we add sizing to the divs. A few different attributes around are 'width', 'height', 'padding', 'margin', and 'border'. The way we manipulate any of these 
              attributes is using either pixels (px) or percent (%). So if we want to make it so that each of the child divs are 50% of the page we first need to make sure that the parent div spreads across 100% of the page
              because the children can only take up as much space as the parent in this example and then just add 'width: 50%;' to the children...
              <img class = "inserted-image" src = "../class-schedule/images/day1image14.png">
              Go ahead and start shrinking the width of the page... you've made responsive design! Whoo-hoo! The next thing we'll look at for today is height. To add that attribute just add 'height: 300px;' or whatever pixel 
              height you'd like to use. Now the height of the div is defined. To see this clearly go ahead and add a background-color to the div. 'background-color: purple;' and 'background-color: grey;'...
